# git-commands-to-add-folder

There are five git commands to add a folder in your git repository:

First in your terminal navigate to the folder that you want to push it to github repository.
Now run these commands one by one in your terminal and your job will be done...

1) git init
2) git add .
3) git commit -m "First Commit"
4) git remote add origin yourRepositoryLink
5) git push origin master

After the 5th command you will be asked to enter your github username and password.

Once you are done with this your job of pushing the folder into github will be done... 

Happy coding!
